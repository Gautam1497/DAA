Experiment 1: Analyze if stack Isempty, Isfull and if elements are present then return top element in stacks using templates and also perform push and pop operation in stack.
Experiment 2: Develop a  program for implementation of power function and determine that complexity should be O(log n) .
Experiment 3: Evaluate the complexity of the developed program to find frequency of elements in a given array.
Experiment 4: 
       i.	Apply the concept of Linked list and write code to Insert and Delete an element at the beginning and end of  Singly Linked List. 
       ii.	Apply the concept of Linked list and write code to Insert and Delete an element at the beginning and at end in Doubly and Circular Linked List.
Experiment 5: Sort a given set of elements using the Quick sort method and determine the    time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted. The elements can be  read from a file or can be generated using the randonumber generator.
Experiment 6: Develop  a  program and analyze complexity to  implement subset-sum problem using Dynamic Programming.
Experiment 7: Develop  a  program and analyze complexity  to implement 0-1 Knapsack using Dynamic Programming.
Experiment 8: Develop  a  program and analyze complexity  to do a depth-first search (DFS) on an undirected graph. Implementing an application of DFS such as (i) to find the topological sort of a directed acyclic graph, OR (ii) to find a path from source to goal in a maze
Experiment 9: Develop  a  program and analyze complexity  to find shortest paths in a graph with positive edge weights using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
Experiment 10: Develop  a  program and analyze complexity  to find all occurrences of a pattern P in a given string S.
